## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution

We propose a mobile-based Smart Crop Advisory System designed specifically for small and marginal farmers. The solution will:

Provide AI-powered, real-time recommendations based on soil data, weather forecasts, and crop history.

Support regional languages with voice commands to aid low-literate users.

Enable pest and disease detection using image recognition.

Track market trends for better crop-selling decisions.

Allow personalized advisory based on location, crop type, and growth stage.

This solution stands out due to its integration of multilingual AI support, voice-enabled interaction, and low-data usability – making it highly inclusive for digitally underserved farmers.

## Technical Approach

Frontend: React Native (for cross-platform mobile app)

Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI), Node.js

AI/ML: TensorFlow / PyTorch for pest detection, NLP models for language support

Database: Firebase / MongoDB

APIs: Weather APIs, Government Agri Data APIs, Market Price APIs

Process Flow:

User logs in via mobile app

Inputs/selects farm data (location, soil type, crops)

Receives personalized recommendations

Uploads images for pest/disease analysis

Gets real-time weather alerts and market prices

Option to ask queries via voice/text in local language

(Include flowchart or UI prototype here if required.)

## Feasibility and Viability

Feasibility: High – given the availability of mobile devices, existing weather/soil APIs, and open-source ML models.

Challenges:

Language diversity

Internet accessibility in rural areas

Building trust among farmers

Mitigation Strategies:

Offline functionality

Local language support

Pilot testing with NGOs and cooperatives

Impact and Benefits

Social Impact: Empowers rural farmers with scientific tools and insights.

Economic Impact: Reduces crop failure and input costs, increases yield and profits.

Environmental Impact: Promotes sustainable farming and reduces chemical overuse.

Technological Impact: Bridges the digital divide in agriculture through inclusive design.
